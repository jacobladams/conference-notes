#Creating Scalable Node.JS Applications###Doug MartinPollenWare  https://github.com/doug-martin  @jrpercussiongithub has presentation and readme explaining info in greater detailcheck out grunt node tool - good way to run various node taskshe used webstorm##Configurationgofigure is module to merge and and monitor config filessplit configurations into logic chunks and then use require to reference them##Loggingused comb.logger##Scaling across cores and machinesnode has core module called cluster which allows scaling across cores but has some drawbackscan have node use fork in cluster to start a new instance of itself when it starts and there aren't enough processes running.  should title each process slightly differently for easier debuggingthis is ok, but has problemsa better approach is a module called **werker**. kind of like a thread pool in which it will spin up and manage processes as needed.werker is a project from C2FO/Pollenwarecan then call something like pool.worker().somemethodby delegating off to a child process, this also solves a lot of blocking problems##Queueinguses RabbitMq for their queuegot a lot more scalability by have a light service call that puts something in the queue. then have another worker process that is listening for items to be added to the queuealso, by having things in queue, it make it more reliable in case web app or service goes downhowever, important to make sure that messages in queue were idempotentfound that using promises has been a really clean way of organizing modules and code
