#Object Oriented Design in the Wild###@jessitronBob Martins 11 OO Design Principles5 SOLID Principles + 6 Package Level PrinciplesSingle Responsibility Pattern   - Object should encapsulate one idea  - Idea should only be in one object"The opposite of Ruby is Haskell"Haskell has more discipline build in, Ruby is more flexible, but that oftern requires more discipline on the part of the developerJavaScript also requires more discipline###Interface Segregation Principle   Pass the minimum possible interface into functions####Reasoning about CodeKnow what code is going to do without running it and with even having to go into the code for a function###Liskov Substitution PrinciplePrinciple of Least Surpise- Have the code work they way people expectUse reasonable namesPolite Functions  * don't access global state  * modify input  * change the world###Dependency Inversion PrincipleC#object -> Interface -> objectfunctional lanuagesfunction -> data -> functionJavaScriptcan use functional constructs like map###Open/Closed PrincipleRelies on a core piece of code which is closed, and extensions which are openAn alternative to dependencies is interactions, don't actually compile in dependencies###Package Principles3x cohesion3x couplingReuse-Release Equivalency PrincipleCode reuse happens at the level of the releasecan accomplish a lot of the decoupling and cohesion principle by using interactions that send messages instead of classic dependenciesstable dependency principleslow level dependencies are more stable and should change less oftenalso get more abstract the lower you gofor the most part our code should be more concrete since our code will be at a higher levelkeep business type code reusable, but utility type code can probably be reusedas time goes on and code become more important, then you move it into the more abstract and reusableDon't prematurely make things reusable and abstract -YAGNIGood idea to keep feature set small so that you can continue to iterate quickly. Its good to occasionally go back and delete unused or lesser used featuresThis will make regression testing easier because the surface area will be smaller
